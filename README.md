-   Estimating G-DINA model and a variety of widely-used models subsumed by the G-DINA model, including the DINA model, DINO model, additive-CDM (A-CDM), linear logistic model (LLM), reduced reparametrized unified model (RRUM), multiple-strategy DINA model for dichotomous responses
-   Estimating models within the G-DINA model framework using user-specified design matrix and link functions
-   Estimating Bugs-DINA, DINO and G-DINA models for dichotomous responses
-   Estimating sequential G-DINA model for ordinal and nominal responses
-   Estimating the diagnostic tree model
-   Modelling independent, saturated, higher-order, loglinear smoothed, and structured joint attribute distribution
-   Accommodating multiple-group model analysis
-   Imposing monotonic constrained success probabilities
-   Accommodating binary and polytomous attributes
-   Validating Q-matrix under the general model framework
-   Evaluating absolute and relative item and model fit
-   Comparing models at the test and item levels
-   Detecting differential item functioning using Wald and likelihood ratio test
-   Simulating data based on all aforementioned CDMs
-   Providing graphical user interface for users less familiar with R
