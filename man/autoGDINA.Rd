\arguments{
\item{dat}{A required \eqn{N \times J} \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} consisting of the
responses of \eqn{N} individuals to \eqn{J} items. Missing values need to be coded as \code{NA}.}

\item{Q}{A required \eqn{J \times K} item or category and attribute association matrix, wher \eqn{J} represents the number of
items or nonzero categories and \eqn{K} represents the number of attributes. For binary attributes,
entry 1 indicates that the attribute is measured by the item, and 0 otherwise.
For polytomous attributes, non-zero elements indicate the level
of attributes that are needed for an individual to answer the item correctly (see Chen, & de la Torre, 2013).
Note that for polytomous items, the sequential G-DINA
model is used and either restricted or unrestricted category-level Q-matrix is needed.
In the category-level Q-matrix, the first column gives the item number, which must be numeric and match the number of column in the data.
The second column indicates the category number. See \code{Examples}.}

\item{modelselection}{logical; conducting model selection or not?}

\item{Qvalid}{logical; validate Q-matrix or not? \code{TRUE} is the default.}

\item{reducedCDM}{a vector specifying which reduced CDMs are possible reduced CDMs for each
item. The default is "DINA","DINO","ACDM","LLM",and "RRUM".}

\item{alpha.level}{nominal level for the Wald test. The default is 0.05.}

\item{modelselectionrule}{how to conducted model selection? Possible options include
\code{simpler}, \code{largestp} and \code{DS}. See \code{Details}.}

\item{eps}{cut-off value for PVAF if \code{Qvalid=TRUE}. The default is 0.95.}

\item{GDINA1.option}{options for initial G-DINA calibration}

\item{GDINA2.option}{options for second G-DINA calibration}

\item{CDM.option}{options for final calibration}

\item{object}{estimated GDINA object for various S3 methods}

\item{...}{additional arguments}
}
\value{
a list consisting of the following elements:
\describe{
\item{GDINA1.obj}{initial GDINA calibration of class \code{GDINA}}
\item{GDINA2.obj}{second GDINA calibration of class \code{GDINA}}
\item{Qval.obj}{Q validation object of class \code{Qval}}
\item{Wald.obj}{model comparison object of class \code{modelcomp}}
\item{CDM.obj}{Final CDM calibration of class \code{GDINA}}
}
}
\description{
\code{autoGDINA} conducts a series of CDM analyses within the G-DINA framework. Particularly,
the GDINA model is fitted to the data first using the \code{\link{GDINA}} function;
then, the Q-matrix is validated using the function \code{\link{Qval}}.
Based on the suggested Q-matrix, the data is fitted by the G-DINA model again, followed
by an item level model selection via the Wald test using \code{\link{modelcomp}}. Lastly,
the selected models are calibrated based on the suggested Q-matrix using the \code{\link{GDINA}} function.
The Q-matrix validation and item-level model selection can be disabled by the users.
Possible reduced CDMs for Wald test include the DINA model, the DINO model, A-CDM, LLM and RRUM.
See \code{Details} for the rules of item-level model selection.
}
\details{
After the Wald statistics for each reduced CDM were calculated for each item, the
reduced models with p values less than the pre-specified alpha level were rejected.
If all reduced models were rejected for an item, the G-DINA model was used as the best model;
if at least one reduced model was retained, three diferent rules can be implemented for selecting
the best model:

when \code{modelselectionrule} is \code{simpler}:

 If (a) the DINA or DINO model
 was one of the retained models, then the DINA or DINO model with the larger p
 value was selected as the best model; but if (b) both DINA and DINO were rejected, the reduced
 model with the largest p value was selected as the best model for this item. Note that
 when the p-values of several reduced models were greater than 0.05, the DINA and DINO models were
 preferred over the A-CDM, LLM, and R-RUM because of their simplicity. This procedure is originally
 proposed by Ma, Iaconangelo, and de la Torre (2016).

 When \code{modelselectionrule} is \code{largestp}:

 The reduced model with the largest p-values is selected as the most appropriate model.

  When \code{modelselectionrule} is \code{DS}:

 The reduced model with non-significant p-values but the smallest dissimilarity index is selected as the most appropriate model.
 Dissimilarity index can be viewed as an effect size measure, which quatifies how dis-similar the reduced model is from the
 G-DINA model. See Ma, Iaconangelo, and de la Torre (2016).
