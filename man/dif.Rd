\usage{
dif(dat, Q, group, method = "wald", p.adjust.methods = "bonferroni",
  LR.type = "free.all", LR.approx = FALSE, difitem = "all", digits = 4,
  SE.type = 2, ...)

\method{summary}{dif}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A required \eqn{N \times J} \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} consisting of the
responses of \eqn{N} individuals to \eqn{J} items. Missing values need to be coded as \code{NA}.}

\item{Q}{A required matrix; The number of rows occupied by a single-strategy dichotomous item is 1, by a polytomous item is
the number of nonzero categories, and by a mutiple-strategy dichotomous item is the number of strategies.
The number of column is equal to the number of attributes if all items are single-strategy dichotomous items, but
the number of attributes + 2 if any items are polytomous or have multiple strategies.
For a polytomous item, the first column represents the item number and the second column indicates the nonzero category number.
For a multiple-strategy dichotomous item, the first column represents the item number and the second column indicates the strategy number.
For binary attributes, 1 denotes the attributes are measured by the items and 0 means the attributes are not
   measured. For polytomous attributes, non-zero elements indicate which level
   of attributes are needed (see Chen, & de la Torre, 2013).  See \code{Examples}.}

\item{group}{a numerical vector with integer 1, 2, ..., # of groups indicating the group each individual belongs to. It must start from 1 and its
length must be equal to the number of individuals.}

\item{method}{DIF detection method; It can be \code{"wald"} for Hou, de la Torre, and Nandakumar's (2014)
Wald test method, and \code{"LR"} for likelihood ratio test (Ma, Terzi, Lee,& de la Torre, 2017).}

\item{p.adjust.methods}{adjusted p-values for multiple hypothesis tests. This is conducted using \code{p.adjust} function in \pkg{stats},
and therefore all adjustment methods supported by \code{p.adjust} can be used, including \code{"holm"},
\code{"hochberg"}, \code{"hommel"}, \code{"bonferroni"}, \code{"BH"} and \code{"BY"}. See \code{p.adjust}
for more details. \code{"bonferroni"} is the default.}

\item{LR.type}{Type of likelihood ratio test for DIF detection. It can be \code{'free.all'} or
\code{'free.one'}.}

\item{LR.approx}{Whether an approximated LR test is implemented? If TRUE, anchor item parameters will not be re-estimated but fixed.}

\item{difitem}{Items for the DIF detection. By default, all items will be examined.}

\item{digits}{How many decimal places in each number? The default is 4.}

\item{SE.type}{Type of standard error estimation methods for the Wald test.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to GDINA function for model calibration}

\item{object}{GDINA object for various S3 methods}
}
\value{
A data frame giving the Wald statistics and associated p-values.
}
\description{
This function is used to detect differential item functioning based on the models estimated
in the \code{\link{GDINA}} function using the Wald test (Hou, de la Torre, & Nandakumar, 2014) and the likelihood ratio
test (Ma, Terzi, Lee, & de la Torre, 2017). It can only detect DIF for two groups currently.
