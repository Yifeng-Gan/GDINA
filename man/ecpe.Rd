\description{
Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English (ECPE) data (the grammar section) has been used
in Henson and Templin (2007), Templin and Hoffman (2013), Feng, Habing, and Huebner (2013), and
Templin and Bradshaw (2014), among others.
}
\details{
The data consists of responses of 2922 examinees to 28 items involving 3 attributes.
Attribute 1 is morphosyntactic rules, Attribute 2 is cohesive rules and
Attribute 3 is lexical rules. In Templin and Hoffman (2013), three attributes are treated as independent.

However, Templin and Bradshaw (2014) have shown that a linear structure exists, that is,
A1 -> A2 -> A3.

The data set is obtained from \url{http://jonathantemplin.com/dcm-workshop-spring-2012-ncme/}.
